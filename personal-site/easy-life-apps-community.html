                The reason why we decided to create this website as our first personal web development project was also the 
                same reason or main theme of the page: "Where your life get easier and the apps you need are just to a few 
                clicks". Personally, we have also felt somewhat suffocated when we enter a web page and see a lot of content, 
                a lot of text, and we can't find the apps or specific pages that we are looking for. Our intention with this 
                page, which will grow in its natural development With time and the experience that we obtain, it is that everyone 
                can get closer to having a fast and direct experience when getting the apps they are looking for, without detours, 
                in an attractive, and visually intuitive way.

                As we are still in progress and development of this web page, we are totally open to receive all the necessary help
                to be able to learn and get ahead with our page while we learn new web development techniques that will help us 
                achieve our goals.
