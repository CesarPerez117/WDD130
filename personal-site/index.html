            <h2>Why Easy Life Apps?</h2>
            <p>Our page called "Easy Life Apps" aims to help all internet users to make their lives easier with 
                the use of technology. We know that today, technology is more than part of our day to day life, 
                it is our lifestyle, to which we have had to adapt while we have learned to move forward with new
                technological updates. Likewise, the creation of applications for our daily use were appearing. </p>
            <h2>What to expect for this page?</h2>
            <p>Do you need an application to organize a presentation at work? Do you want a complete image editor? 
                Do you want an application that allows you to view multimedia content? Do you want to download music? 
                Easy Life Apps is your page, and that is the reason why it exists. This is a great library of applications 
                prepared for each of your needs, and since it is interactive, the library is always expanding and 
                updating, as more useful applications are found and disclosed. </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>The main function of our page is to be able to see the available applications divided into two blocks. 
                First, free and easily accessible applications, and second, paid applications. This is in order to be 
                able to separate the applications based on the needs of our visitors and thus facilitate the search 
                for various applications. In addition, with the aim of creating an interactive community, we will also 
                have the rating available. This will allow users who visit our page to assess the applications based 
                on their previous experiences and give value to the applications. From time to time, we will be able 
                to update this information and create Top ratings for the applications, always divided into paid and 
                free applications, so that users can choose between the best rated ones if they want a reference of good
                applications. Also, we want to apply the "Random app" segment, this segment will be based on being able 
                to search for a random application from our library and make it known to our users, this will also give 
                a chance for applications with low ratings to be known and used. </p>
            <h2>So… again… Why Easy Life Apps?</h2>
            <p>Easy Life Apps is an opportunity for us as a large community to work together to provide help to each 
                other in this modern world. </p>
